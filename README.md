# EuroPython 2019: Functional Programming with Python
I hosted an interactive session about functional programming 
at the EuroPython 2019 in Basel, using this Jupyter notebook.

## Install
To get up and running, create a Python 3 virtualenv, install the requirements and start jupyter:

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab  # or `jupyter notebook` if you prefer
```

## Re-use
Feel free to re-use, change and publish the notebook in any setting (MIT Licence) - please just link back to this GitHub repo as your source.

The notebook is set up to work as an interactive presentation using [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io), a simpe-to-use jupyter plugin.
